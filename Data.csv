uncritically Ultimately design decisions must based since analogies misleading well In essay address role aesthetics programming language I base remarks book structural The Tower David Although many differences bridges programming find many ideas insights transfer rather According three values common many technological call three Economy These values correspond three dimensions Billington calls social symbolic dimensions three We consider Efficiency Seeks Minimize Resources Used In structural efficiency deals amount material basic criterion safety issues scientific disposition programming language efficiency scientific question dealing use There many examples efficiency considerations influenced programming language design reviewed Principles Programming In early resources minimized often runtime memory usage processing although resource utilization also In cases resource economized programmer typing cases compromised safety implicit There also many cases security sacrificed sake efficiency neglecting runtime error checking array bounds Efficiency issues often quantified terms computer memory must careful comparing apples Compile time interchangeable run neither one programmer computer memory cannot traded computer time unless reduced common brings economic Economy Seeks Maximize Benefit versus Cost Whereas efficiency scientific economy social In structural economy seeks maximize social benefit compared especially appropriate since structures like bridges usually built public expense benefit In programming language must satisfied programming community use language

monetary All kinds must considered seeking economical Elegance Symbolizes Good Design Who cares snorts Billington shows clearly critical role elegance For Designer It feature interaction poses serious problem language designers difficulty analyzing possible interactions features language Principles Structural engineers face similar problems analytic Billington observes best designers make extensive use computer models One reason mathematical analysis always The engineer must make decision variables significant analysis may lead incorrect conclusions decision made equations often simplified made make analysis another potential source Because engineers depend mathematical analysis may overdesign structure compensate unforeseen effects left Thus price safety additional material increased cost decreased efficiency Similarly programming language limitations analytic approach often force us make choice run risk unanticipated inefficient Many people seen famous film collapse 1940 Tacoma Narrows vibrated pieces storm aerodynamical stability considered Billington explains along number less dramatic bridge consequence increasing use theoretical analyses began problem destroyed Tacoma Narrows bridge anticipated avoided century bridge designers guided aesthetic According best structural engineers rely mathematical analysis abandon design activity guided sense This solutions structural engineering problems usually greatly many possible solutions particular bridging particular expert designers restrict attention designs interaction forces easy The design looks unbalanced forces design looks stable The general principle designs look good also therefore design process guided aesthetics without extensive mathematical Billington expresses idea inverting old architectural maxim asserting structural function follows He adds form well analysis becomes astoundingly In choice form open pick forms elegant design expresses good design efficient economical If let aesthetics

manifest balance forces bridge gives us confidence cross So manifestly good design programming language reinforce confidence program confidence consequences We accomplish little covering unbalanced structure beautiful When bridge unable sustain load much matter beautiful So also programming If elegance manifestation deep coherence programmers quickly see illusion loose In good designers choose
